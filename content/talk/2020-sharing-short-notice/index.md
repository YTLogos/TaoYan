> This webinar was designed to help educators who needed to quickly transition to remote teaching due to COVID-19.


Educators create a lot of files for teaching- slides, exercises, solutions, assignments, data, figures- that all ultimately need to be shared with other people. Having a link for sharing your teaching materials can save you time and pain, but it is hard to get started if you’ve never shared your resources online before. In this webinar, we’ll give a tour of the R Markdown ecosystem for educators that you can start to use right away. We’ll show how it can help you make your teaching more shareable, reproducible, and resilient.
