abstract = "Rapeseed (Brassica napus) is an important oilseed crop and widely planted in the world. In our previous study, we collected 991 accessions of rapeseed from the worldwide germplasm and revealed the genetic polymorphisms within this germplasm by whole - genome resequencing. However, management of such a large amount of accessions is time - consuming, laborious and costly. Therefore, we constructed a worldwide core collection of rapeseed germplasm consisting of 300 accessions based on their genetic diversity. Compared with 991 accessions, the worldwide core collection showed similar geographic distribution, the proportion of ecotypes and nucleotide diversity. These results indicate that the genetic diversity of the worldwide core collection can represent that of 991 accessions. Moreover, 43 significantly associated SNPs for waterlogging tolerance of rapeseed at the seedling stage were identified by the genome - wide association study (GWAS) using the core collection. A major QTL was found at Chr. C07 and 11 candidate genes within this region encoding squalene monooxygenase, GDSL esterase/lipase and calcineurin B - like protein 4. The results indicate that the 300 accessions of the worldwide core collection could be more efficiently used for phenotypic and genetic studies in rapeseed."
