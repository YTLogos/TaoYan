I am a PhD student of Crop Genetics and Breeding at the *Zhejiang University* Crop Science Lab. My Ph.D research work covers a range of issues : **Population Genetics Evolution and Ecotype Divergence Analysis of oilseed Rape**, **Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of Agronomic Traits**. Currently, I am interested in Transposable Elements Insertion Polymorphisms (TIPs) in Crop Population and genetic basis such as SV, CNV and TIPs etc shapes the diversity of different morphotypes of *B.napus*.
