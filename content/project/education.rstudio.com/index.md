RStudio’s mission is:

> “To equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy.”

Our education team supports this mission broadly by supporting people who want to learn R (or learn new things in R), and those who want to teach them. This website is designed for both. This website was built with Hugo, using a theme I developed and maintain. I worked with my former intern, [Desirée De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io), to create the original artwork we used for the website.
