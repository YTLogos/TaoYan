In this workshop, Dr. Alison Hill and Robin Champieux demonstrated tools and methods for building transparency within a lab, and onboarding new graduate students and postdocs. We provided a [template GitHub repository](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub) and code of conduct designed to facilitate a healthy and productive learning and research environment. You are encouraged to use these tools to communicate expectations, document protocols, receive feedback, and facilitate the long-term value of students’ and trainees’ contributions.

Labhub is a *work in progress*. We created [this repository](https://github.com/apreshill/labhub) as an education and demonstration tool for faculty, postdocs, and students curious about how documentation, open science workflows, and tools like Github can contribute to a healthy and productive research environment. Your ideas and contributions are welcome!
