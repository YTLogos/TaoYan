abstract = "Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oil crop world - widely cultivated, and seed oil content (SOC) is one of the most important traits for rapeseed. To increase SOC, many efforts for promoting the function of genes on lipid biosynthesis pathway have been previously made. However, seed oil formation is a dynamic balance between lipid synthesis and breakdown. It is, therefore, also reasonable to weaken or eliminate the function of genes involved in lipid degradation for a higher final SOC. We applied a genome - wide association study (GWAS) on SOC in a collection of 290 core germplasm accessions. A total of 2,705,480 high - quality SNPs were used in the GWAS, and we identified BnaC07g30920D, a patatin - like lipase (PTL) gene, that was associated with SOC. In particular, six single - nucleotide - polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of BnaC07g30920D were associated with the significant reduction of SOC, leading to a 4.7â€“6.2% reduction of SOCs. We performed in silico analysis to show a total of 40 PTLs, which were divided into four clades, evenly distributed on the A and C subgenomes of Brassica napus. RNA - seq analysis unveiled that BnPTLs were preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues especially maturing seeds. We identified BnaC07g30920D, a BnPTL gene, that was associated with SOC using GWAS and performed in silico analysis of 40 PTLs in Brassica napus. The results enrich our knowledge about the SOC formation in rapeseed and facilitate the future study in functional characterization of BnPTL genes."
