+ Templates within a package
+ Shareable [scientific/technical articles](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/basics.html), [slides](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html), [dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), and [websites](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/websites.html)
