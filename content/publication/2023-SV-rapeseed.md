abstract = "Flowering time plays a critical role in determining the life cycle length, yield, and quality of a crop. However, the allelic polymorphism of flowering time-related genes (FTRGs) in Brassica napus, an important oil crop, remains unclear. Here, we provide high-resolution graphics of FTRGs in B. napus on a pangenome-wide scale based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and structural variation (SV) analyses. A total of 1337 FTRGs in B. napus were identified by aligning their coding sequences with Arabidopsis orthologs. Overall, 46.07% of FTRGs were core genes and 53.93% were variable genes. Moreover, 1.94%, 0.74%, and 4.49% FTRGs had significant presence-frequency differences (PFDs) between the spring and semi - winter, spring and winter, and winter and semi - winter ecotypes, respectively. SNPs and SVs across 1626 accessions of 39 FTRGs underlying numerous published qualitative trait loci were analyzed. Additionally, to identify FTRGs specific to an eco - condition, genome - wide association studies (GWASs) based on SNP, presence/absence variation (PAV), and SV were performed after growing and observing the flowering time order (FTO) of plants in a collection of 292 accessions at three locations in two successive years. It was discovered that the FTO of plants in a genetic population changed a lot across various environments, and homolog copies of some key FTRGs played different roles in different locations. This study revealed the molecular basis of the genotype - by - environment (G Ã— E) effect on flowering and recommended a pool of candidate genes specific to locations for breeding selection."
