Using one dataset from The Great British Bake Off, I show eleven ways to visualize one dataset using eleven different versions of "tidy data." Take-away messages:

+ Tidy data is the start of your data wrangling journey, not the end
+ There is not a single "tidy" version of a dataset
+ Tidy data *does* make you more nimble!
