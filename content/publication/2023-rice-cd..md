abstract = "Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal that can be readily absorbed by plants and enriched in human body. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield and grain quality are affected by excessive Cd in the soil. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of Cd absorption, accumulation and detoxification in the root apex is crucial for developing low-Cd rice cultivars. After Cd treatment, Cd concentration in rice root tips (RT) was 1.4 times higher than that in basal roots (BR). To uncover the distinct molecular responses to Cd toxicity, we conducted transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses on the two root sections. The results revealed that the RT exhibited 1.2-2.0 fold higher transcript or protein abundance of several Cd-related transporters than the BR, including Nramp1, Nramp5, IRT1, and HMA3, thereby contributing to more Cd accumulation in the RT. Furthermore, multi-omics analysis unveiled that the RT had enhanced activity in 'phenylpropanoid metabolism', 'AsA-GSH cycle' and 'tryptophan metabolism', conferring the stronger antioxidant system. While the BR showed higher activation in 'cell wall remodeling' and 'terpenoid biosynthesis'. This comprehensive study provides insights into the regulatory network of genes, proteins and metabolites involved in the differential responses to Cd toxicity between rice root tips and mature zones."
