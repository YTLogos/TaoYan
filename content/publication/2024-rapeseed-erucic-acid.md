abstract = "Through comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we identified a set of 23 genes that act up- or downstream of erucic acid content (EAC) production in rapeseed seeds. We selected example genes to showcase the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms, haplotypes associated with EAC phenotypes, and the creation of molecular markers differentiating low EAC and high EAC genotypes. Erucic acid content (EAC) is a crucial trait in rapeseed, with low LEAC oil recognized for its health benefits and high EA oil holding industrial value. Despite its significance, the genomic consequences of intensive LEAC-cultivar selection and the genetic basis underlying EA regulation remain largely unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted selective signal analyses, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and transcriptome analyses. Our investigation unveiled the genetic footprints resulting from LEAC selection in germplasm populations, drawing attention to specific loci that contribute to enriching diversity. By integrating GWAS and transcriptome analyses, we identified a set of 23 genes that play a significant role in determining EAC in seeds or are downstream consequences of EA-level alterations. These genes have emerged as promising candidates for elucidating the potential mechanisms governing EAC in rapeseed. To exemplify the findings, we selected specific genes to demonstrate the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes associated with different EAC phenotypes. Additionally, we showcased to develop molecular markers distinguishing between LEAC and high EAC genotypes."
