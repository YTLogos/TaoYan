abstract = "Genetic variation is an important determinant of gene transcription, which in turn contributes to functional and phenotypic diversity. Identification of the genetic variants controlling gene expression and alternative splicing in crops responding to cadmium (Cd), an important issue for food safety and human health, is of great value to improve our understanding of Cd accumulation-related genes. Here we report an in-depth survey of population-level transcriptome variation of barley (Hordeum vulgare) core accessions under Cd exposure. We reveal marked transcriptomic changes in response to Cd exposure, and these are largely independent of tissues. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed 59 498 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 23 854 splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), leading to a complex network that covers 66.6% of the expressed genes, including 68 metal transporter genes. On average, 41.0% of sQTLs overlapped with eQTLs across different tissues, indicating that these two dimensions of transcript variation are largely independent. Moreover, we found that 34.5% of GWAS QTLs that underlie 10 Cd accumulation traits in barley are co-localized with eQTLs and sQTLs, which could imply a mechanistic role of different genetic variants affecting gene expression and alternative splicing in these traits. This study highlights the role of distal and proximal genetic effects on gene expression, splicing, and phenotypic plasticity. We anticipate that our results on the genetic control of expression and splicing underlying Cd accumulation provide a bridge to better understand genetic variation and phenotypic diversity to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Cd accumulation in plants."
