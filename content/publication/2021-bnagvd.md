abstract = "Rapeseed (*Brassica napus* L.) is a typical polyploid crop and one of the most important oilseed crops worldwide. With the rapid progress on high-throughput sequencing technologies and the reduction in sequencing cost, large-scale genomic data of a specific crop have become available. However, raw sequence data are mostly deposited in the sequence read archive of the National Center of Biotechnology Information and the European Nucleotide Archive, which is freely accessible to all researchers. Extensive tools for practical purposes should be developed to efficiently utilize these large raw data. Here, we report a web-based rapeseed genomic variation database (BnaGVD, http://rapeseed.biocloud.net/home) from which genomic variations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) across a worldwide collection of rapeseed accessions, can be referred. The current release of the BnaGVD contains 34,591,899 high-quality SNPs and 12,281,923 high-quality InDels and provides search tools to retrieve genomic variations and gene annotations across 1,007 accessions of worldwide rapeseed germplasm. We implement a variety of built-in tools (e.g. BnaGWAS, BnaPCA and BnaStructure) to help users perform in-depth analyses. We recommend this web resource for accelerating studies on the functional genomics and the screening of molecular markers for rapeseed breeding."
