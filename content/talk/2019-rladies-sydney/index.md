Using data from 10 series of The Great British Bake Off, we will walk through eleven ways to visualize the same data using the `ggplot2` package. We'll talk a lot about geoms and variable mappings, but also about what it means to "tidy your data", plus the new pivot functions in the `tidyr` package.

You won't need your laptops but you will get the most out of this talk if you know some basics about using `ggplot2`. To brush up (or start learning now), you may want to play with the free RStudio.cloud [data visualization primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3) (you may use an existing Google or GitHub account to log in). Or of course you can check out [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/)'s own [VizW(h)iz Module](https://rladiessydney.org/post/2018/12/20/vizwhiz/) of [#RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/ryouwithme)!
